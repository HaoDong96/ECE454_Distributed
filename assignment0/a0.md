1. union by rank 
  input:(1,2)
    (1,3)
    (4,5)
    (2,5)
  object representing nodes

- object 1( rank = 0), 2( rank = 0)

- because of the edge(1,2):
  find(1) -> 1
  find(2) -> 2
  they are in different union, so we have to union them
  make a subtree with 1 as root ( rank = 1), 2 as child( rank = 0)

- because of the edge(1,3):
  find(1) -> 1
  find(3) -> 1
  we have to union them
  1 as root( rank = 1), 2,3 as children( rank = 0)

- same thing happens on (4,5)

- because of the edge(2,5):
  find(2) -> 1
  find(5) -> 4
  1 as root( rank = 2), 2,3,5 as children ( rank = 1), 4 as grandchild( rank = 0)


2. path compression
  compress:
  connect 1 and 4
